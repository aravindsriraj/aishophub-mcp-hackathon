# AI Shopping Hub

An AI-powered shopping hub that can search products using semantic search. Operations like adding to cart, adding to wishlist, checkout, list previous orders and various other operations can be performed using the APIs (read openapi.yaml to know more). All these APIs have been deployed as MCP server using Cequence AI gateway.

## Team Information

**Team:** AI-Samurai  
**Member:** Aravindan

## Hackathon Challenge

**Theme 2:** Build a Secure MCP Server for Agents (w/ Cequence)

## What We Built

AI Shopping Hub is a comprehensive e-commerce platform with all API endpoints exposed as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Users can shop through the website performing AI-powered semantic search, adding to cart, adding to wishlist, checkout, completing orders - all operations detailed in the OpenAPI specification. Users can access these capabilities through any MCP client like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.

**üåê Live Demo**: The website has been deployed on Replit and is accessible at [https://aishophub.replit.app](https://aishophub.replit.app)

**üîç Semantic Search Service**: The AI-powered semantic search is implemented as a separate Python FastAPI application, deployed on Replit at [https://product-search.replit.app/docs](https://product-search.replit.app/docs). The semantic search codebase is available at [https://github.com/aravindsriraj/aishophub-semantic-search-fastapi](https://github.com/aravindsriraj/aishophub-semantic-search-fastapi)

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Semantic Search**: Natural language product search capabilities powered by dedicated FastAPI service
- **MCP Server Integration**: All APIs accessible through Model Context Protocol
- **Secure API Gateway**: Deployed using Cequence AI gateway for enhanced security
- **Cloud Deployment**: Fully deployed and accessible on Replit platform
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate semantic search service for enhanced performance

## How to Use with Claude Desktop

1. **Login to the platform**: Visit [aishophub.replit.app](https://aishophub.replit.app)
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to the settings page in your account
3. **Generate API Token**: Create a new API token for MCP access
4. **Configure Claude Desktop**: Add the MCP server configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`
5. **Add MCP Server Configuration**:

```json
"mcp-server-bearer": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "mcp-remote",
    "https://ztaip-cuk221kt-4xp4r634bq-uc.a.run.app/mcp",
    "--header",
    "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>",
    "--transport",
    "http-only"
  ]
}
```

6. **Restart Claude Desktop**: Restart the application to load the new MCP server
